# Web Scraper for https://www.investing.com/equities/trending-stocks


Web scrapping is an important aspect of building Machine learning models. As we know data is kind of a backbone of any machine learning task. Through web scrapping we collect all the requisite data which is not well formatted and available to us. In this use case we will be scraping the details from a financial website https://www.investing.com/equities/trending-stocks.

We have multiple task to perform as we have different blocks of the website from where we need to scrape the details. And it has variety of objects. We have data in normal text,we have data in visual format and also in tabular format. As for some task we need to hover around multiple tabs to get data.

In this task I have used Python as our programming language and used Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries to get the task done effectively.
